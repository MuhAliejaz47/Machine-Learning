To get this program running you need to install Moviepy and Assemblyai.
To do that run the commands given below in your cmd.

Step 1:

pip install moviepy
pip install assemblyai


Step 2:

GOTO:
https://www.assemblyai.com

Click on the "Get Started With The API" button in the top right corner of the window.

Enter your mail and copy the API-Key and enter it in the code at:

aai.settings.api_key = ""

Step 3:

If you are using my given video or your own video make sure that the video is in the same folder in which your code file is.
You can also provide the full path in:

input_video_path = ""

if the video is somewhere else.


Note:

In this project, I have used AssemblyAI which is a free tool to convert the audio to text.
I tried to use speech recognition but as you can see I am using a very noisy video with not very clear and clean audio it did not perform well.
Two or three words are off but Assemblyai did a good enough Job.
