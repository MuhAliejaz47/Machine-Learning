Making it Functional:

You will need to run these three commands in your command line:

pip install nltk
pip install textblob
pip install newspaper3k

About:

This is my very basic text sentiment analysis program.
It uses first the newspaper articles to predict the score between -1 and 1 where -1 is very negative and 1 is very positive.
Next, thing is that we use our own generated text to see how well the program can predict the sentiment of a text.
Change the program as you like make changes in the positive, negative, and neutral text files to see the change.
Use Different URL links of different articles to see how every article is treated by the code.
Instead of using the summary use the whole text to see the difference,
Make the code you own. Enjoy :)
