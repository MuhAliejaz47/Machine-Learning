Let's get started.

Basic Requirements:

Visual Studio Code that runs jupyter notebook.

Step 2:

Open the instrument detection file in visual studio code.

Click on the terminal on the left upper part of the screen.

and run these commands:

pip install matplotlib.pylpot

pip install os

pip install cv2

pip install numpy

pip install tensorflow

pip install keras

you might have most of these things already but I am just making sure.


Step 3:

You should have the whole dataset downloaded on your system.

Go and extract the dataset if you haven't yet.

It will have 3 folders after extraction.

frames,tool_annotation and phase_annotation.

Forget the phase annotation.

Copy or cut the frames and tool_annotations folders

and paste them in the folder you have the instruments detection file.

make sure that the folder names are exactly 'frames' and 'tool_annotations' (case sensitive).


Step 4:

Open the instrument detection.ipynb and run each cell in order one after the other. 


Step5:

Once you have done the training and want to see how your model is doing make a test folder.
 
Transfer one video folder to that test folder and run the cells below the training cells to get the predictions.
