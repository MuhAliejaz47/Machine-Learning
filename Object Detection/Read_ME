For this program to run. You need to install opencv by:
pip install opencv (assuming you have installed the basic libraries like numpy and pandas)
All necessary files are already present in the folder so you do not need to download anything.
This is an Object Detection machine learning task. 
It uses COCO as a dataset. 
It has 80 classes. 
Implementation of the program is done on an image and also a video.  
You can change the Video and the Image to make the code your own.
In case of any queries you can contact me I will be happy to help :)
